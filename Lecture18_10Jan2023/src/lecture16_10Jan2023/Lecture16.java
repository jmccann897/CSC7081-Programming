	 * Enum - shorthand for enumerated list
	 * Type whos set is a predefined set of constants for example 
	 * days of the week
	 * compass directions
	 * For our course only worry about enums info covered in course, can become complex if searched online
	 * Bascially a group of constants
	 * Public static constants should be written in uppercase
	 * Can't use spaces or special characters
	 * 
	 * Enums have some inbuilt methods such as valueOf, which takes in a string, returns type of enum
	 * Useful for when reading in String from File and needed to convert to enum type
	 * If misspelt, will throw an error
	 * Can possibly use wrapper to convert
