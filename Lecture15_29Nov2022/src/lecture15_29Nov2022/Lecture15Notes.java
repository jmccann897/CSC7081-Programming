		// OOP programming

		// all nouns could be objects
		// methods are object actions /activities?
		// class is like the recipe or blueprint
		// instances are the food output or car built from blueprint
		// this allows code re-use for efficiency  and reliability
		// as classes can be reused to build many objects
		// so far we have been writing class level methods,
		// now we will write object level methods
		
		//Unified Modelling Language are commonly used to design/describe classes
		// top level objects
		// mid level instances
		// bottom level method calls
		
		
		//so far all variables were declared within a method
		// i.e. only dealt with local variables - scope is local
		// classes in OOP have methods and attributes
		// attributes are variables that belong to each instance of the class
		// known as instance variables
		// A class normally has methods that use attributes of a object
		// known as getters (accessors) and setters (mutators)
		// Nb: instance variables are generally private as don't want user to change
